/**
* @mainpage
 * This SIL software inputs a binary data file from Larus flight logger
 * and feeds the sensor readings through the original flight processing algorithms.
 *
 * The output is either a binary data file with all derived properties
 * or information going to a XCsoar instance in real-time via TCP.
 *
 * Additionally CAN bus data in the Larus format can be tunneled
 * through a USB->USART dongle to an AD57 flight display.

 * The complete project is hosted at https://github.com/larus-breeze
